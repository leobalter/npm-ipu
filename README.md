# npm-ipu
Safe npm updates. It literally just runs `npm install`, `npm prune`, and `npm update`.

An alias solves that as well.

This module will be discontinued as soon as I can have an npm alias configuration or run these commands at once.

## Install

You need npm to be installed and running in your path.

```shell
npm install -g npm-ipu
```

## Running

From your repo's folder:

```
npm-ipu
```
